Datacamp is an online learning platform that has helped me build data skills at my own pace. I have learned the essentials of MS Excel Data Analysis, BI tools such as Power BI, SQL querying and Python for Data Science applications.

DataCamp provide multiple learning experiences, including data skill assessments to track progress and provide personalized recommendations, interactive courses led by experts, practice challenges, and real-world projects.

This repository was created to host the projects I have completed so far. More to come soon!
